The cognitiveVR SDK for Unreal
=========
Welcome!  This SDK allows you to integrate your Unreal games with cognitiveVR, which provides analytics and insights about your project.  In addition, cognitiveVR empowers you with the ability to take actions that will improve users' engagement with your experience.

See [docs.cognitive.io](http://docs.cognitivevr.io/unreal/get-started/) for details about gettings started.

This SDK supports both C++ and Blueprints.

This has been tested on Vive and Oculus Rift on Windows 10. This plugin has been tested with Unreal verion 4.14.3. Newer versions may require additional steps to integrate.
