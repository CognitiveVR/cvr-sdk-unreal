## FILE SIZE WARNING!
There's a file that exceeds github's 100mb limit. this is the CognitiveVRTest.VC.db and is zipped and included. this needs to be unzipped and put into the project folder. I will totally fix this soon

Development
=========
## Internal
This repo is currently only used internally! No nicely distributed packages are available at the moment. Everything _seems_ to be working fine, but not a whole lot of the SDK has been tested.
